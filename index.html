    <p1>Rocky is a 17 year old cat who enjoys spending his time laying around. 
        He likes watching birds and trying to talk to them. 
        While he loves birds from afar, he is not a fan of any other animals and enjoys terrorizing the dog, Oliver.

    <p2>Rocky is also a big fan of eating. He will do anything for a treat and likes any and all foods. 
        He will gladly sneak onto the dinner table to sample any and all foods. 
        If he does not enjoy eating the food, Rocky is fine with playing with it instead.
