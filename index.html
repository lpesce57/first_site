    <div><h2>Rocky</h2>
        <img src="rocky.jpg" alt="Black cat sleeping on red blanket" width="400">
        <p1> Rocky is a 17 year old cat who enjoys spending his time laying around. He likes watching birds and trying to talk to them. 
            While he loves birds from afar, he is not a fan of any other animals and enjoys terrorizing the dog, Oliver.</p1>
            <p2>Rocky is also a big fan of eating. He will do anything for a treat and likes any and all foods. 
                He will gladly sneak onto the dinner table to sample any and all foods. If he does not enjoy eating the food, 
                Rocky is fine with playing with it instead.
            </p2>

<div><h2>Happy</h2>
    <img src="happy_sleep.jpg" alt="Black and grey cat laying on bed, near asleep" width="400">
    <p1> Happy is an old cat. He spends a lot of his day lounging around, in whatever spot he feels is most comfortable at the time. 
        He is an indoor cat, but whenever we open the door to let the dogs out, he always comes running out so he can eat grass.
    </p1>
        <p2>Happy is pretty friendly with one of my dogs, Katie. They do not interact much, but when they do, it is usually just friendly sniffs. 
            My other dog, Izzy, however, loves biting at Happy. 
            Happy usually will just run away, but sometimes he will retalliate by giving Izzy a smack! It is all in good fun though.

        Luke loves chicken cat treats, they are her favorite.</p1>
        <p2>Luke is very badly behaved. He often jumps up on furniture and drinks out of our water glasses.

<div><h2>Molly</h2>
    <img src="molly_on_cabinet.jpg" alt="Calico cat with orange, white, and black coloring sitting on cabinet" width="400">
    <p1> Molly is an 18 year old calico cat. She prefers spending her days lounging on the couch or curled up sleeping over a vent (or anything warm).
         Occasionally, she will go outside and attempt to hunt birds or rats (sometimes successful which is terrifying).</p1>
        <p2>Her favorite habit is to brush against our legs, especially during dinner when everyone is seated around a table. 
            She is an attention seeker, always meowing to get as many pets and head rubs as she possibly can.</p2>

<div><h2>Lucy</h2>
    <img src="Lucy.jpg" alt="Calico with white, orange, and black coloring" width="400">
    <p1>Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I have had since I was 5, she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. 
        Even though she is old she is still kicking it and enjoys running around the house at 4am.</p1>
        <p2>Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, along with lots of petting. 
            However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.</p2>
